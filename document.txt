MarketPlace - Product Detail Prototype
Design Choices and Development Challenges

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Full-stack e-commerce product detail page prototype inspired by MercadoLibre, 
implementing hexagonal architecture with comprehensive testing and containerization.

================================================================================
DESIGN CHOICES
================================================================================

1. ARCHITECTURE
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) for separation of concerns
- Backend: Domain → Application → Infrastructure layers
- Frontend: Domain → Application → Infrastructure layers
- Enables testability and flexibility to swap adapters

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
- Backend: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.2.5, Amazon Corretto 21
- Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit + Saga
- Storage: JSON file-based (no database required)
- Styling: CSS Modules for scoped styling
- Testing: JUnit 5 + Mockito (backend), Jest + React Testing Library (frontend)

3. ERROR HANDLING
- Custom exceptions (ProductNotFoundException, ValidationException)
- Global exception handler with @ControllerAdvice
- Standardized ErrorResponse DTO with timestamps
- Frontend API interceptors for centralized error handling

4. TESTING & QUALITY
- 80%+ code coverage requirement
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and component tests
- JaCoCo for backend coverage, Jest for frontend coverage

5. CONTAINERIZATION
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized images
- Docker Compose with development and production profiles
- Nginx for production frontend serving

================================================================================
CHALLENGES FACED AND SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

1. TESTING FRAMEWORK COMPATIBILITY
Challenge: Test failures due to import issues and missing dependencies
Solution: Fixed imports, added dependencies, created comprehensive test suite

2. JAKARTA VALIDATION MIGRATION
Challenge: Spring Boot 3.x migration from javax to jakarta namespace
Solution: Updated imports to jakarta.validation.*, integrated with global handler

3. DOCKER BUILD OPTIMIZATION
Challenge: Large images and slow build times
Solution: Multi-stage builds, .dockerignore files, Alpine images, layer caching

4. CORS CONFIGURATION
Challenge: Frontend-backend communication issues across environments
Solution: Comprehensive CorsConfig with proper origin patterns and headers

5. STATE MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY
Challenge: Managing loading states, errors, and async operations
Solution: Redux Toolkit + Saga with clear action patterns (start/success/failure)

6. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
Challenge: Mobile-first responsive layout with complex components
Solution: CSS Modules with Grid/Flexbox, proper breakpoints, device testing

7. ERROR HANDLING CONSISTENCY
Challenge: Inconsistent error formats across application layers
Solution: Global exception handler, standardized ErrorResponse DTO, proper logging

================================================================================
TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
================================================================================

• Hexagonal architecture implementation across full stack
• 80%+ test coverage on both frontend and backend
• Production-ready Docker containerization with multi-environment support
• Comprehensive error handling system with custom exceptions
• Responsive, mobile-first user interface
• Modern development workflow with hot reload and optimized builds

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This project demonstrates modern full-stack development practices emphasizing 
clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and production-ready deployment. 
Challenges were systematically addressed through proper tooling and best practices, 
resulting in a maintainable, scalable codebase ready for production deployment.

The hexagonal architecture ensures adaptability to changing requirements while 
maintaining code quality. The comprehensive error handling provides excellent 
user experience, and containerized deployment ensures consistent environments 
across development and production.
